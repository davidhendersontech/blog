# First week in Flatiron school
What if, on almost entirely a whim, you decided to completely change your life? Well that's exactly what I did when I decided to join Flatiron school. Flatiron School is a coding bootcamp, a program designed to give you everything you need to know to be a full stack software dev given to you in a nice 16 week present.
My first week here recently came to a close and with the start of week 2 I thought what better way to document everything I've learned than to share it with you (my beautifully faithful github audience).So grab a coffee, get comfy and join me for the week 1 recap.

## Nerves and Newfriends
My program started on March 16th 2021.I logged onto slack to click the link that had just been sent to me. 12 other beautiful people greeted me and our group was ceremoniously dubbed the "New Friends". Now us newfriends were, well, new to it all and I had no idea what to expect. 
- How would classes be scheduled?
- We had 50 people in standdown and only 12 in our class?
- How hard was this whole thing going to be?
- Who even, out of the 50, were our instructors?
