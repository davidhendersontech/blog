# First week in Flatiron school
What if, on almost entirely a whim, you decided to completely change your life? Well that's exactly what I did when I decided to join Flatiron school. Flatiron School is a coding bootcamp, a program designed to give you everything you need to know to be a full stack software dev given to you in a nice 16 week present.
My first week here recently came to a close and with the start of week 2 I thought what better way to document everything I've learned than to share it with you (my beautifully faithful github audience).So grab a coffee, get comfy and join me for the week 1 recap.

## Nerves and Newfriends
My program started on March 16th 2021.I logged onto slack to click the link that had just been sent to me. 12 other beautiful people greeted me and our group was ceremoniously dubbed the "New Friends". Now us newfriends were, well, new to it all and I had no idea what to expect. 
- How would classes be scheduled?
- We had 50 people in standdown and only 12 in our class?
- How hard was this whole thing going to be?
- Who even, out of the 50, were our instructors?

With any new program theres bounds to be lots of Nerves. I mean I really didn't know what I was getting myself into. All I knew to expect was a lot of work and a lot of things to learn. I got all of that on my first day and one thing I wasn't expecting: A group of new friends to work through it with.

The Flatiron School program would be nothing without it's tight knit community. You can tell from the second you join that these people *want* to help you. They *want* to see you succeed. And the real strength is having a cohort that I also want to succeed. If I'm ever stuck on a problem, already I know that I will be able to go to multiple people to get help and work on the problem together. 

## Class Schedules
Everyday starts with a stand up. That's when everyone in the Denver campus (and sometimes some alumni) all join a zoom call together and plan out the day. We talk about what we want to learn about that day, the general plan for the day, and just start our day off together. After that I'll join meditation that's hosted by one of the other students while the instructors take what we wanted to learn about and turn it into a full lesson plan. I really don't know how they can come up with the lessons so quick but it's amazing to have access to an instantly tailorable schedule. 

The entire campus is split up into phases 0 - 5. With 0 being the prework before you start. Each phase lasts about two weeks. The first week you learn everything you need to know about that phase's subjects. Each class is joinable by anyone but mostly grouped by your phase. You code along with the instructor answering questions as you go. If you can't tell already a huge theme to Flatiron School is you're never alone. Essentially you're learning a whole new language; a whole new way to think. I don't think I have to say that learning a whole new language on your own can be incredibly daunting, and Flatiron school does a great job of making you a part of a group.

BUT DAVID, I hear you saying, "Whenever you're in a job you might have to take on challenges by yourself". Thank you, my made up friend, for that perfect segue. Welcome to week 2, your first coding challenge!  You'll have 90 minutes to write code covering everything you've learned so far. Don't worry though, IT'S NOT A TEST. You take the coding challenge in 90 minutes, once a day. After you take the test an instructor will contact you and you'll both go over your code together. This allows Flatiron School to know where you're at in your journey and make sure they can touch on everything you absolutely need to know before moving on. Today will be the first time I take a coding challenge so I'll make sure to keep you guys updated.

## First week Wrap Up

I'm going to write another blog post to go over everything that we've learned so far and recap what everything does. That just leaves my thoughts...

<pre> <b> I LOVE IT </b> </pre>

I came from a computer science degree program in college. I knew then that I could do programming as a job. Time flew by when I was working on code. Once I got bit by a challenge I had to keep working on it till I finished it. Sadly, this was exclusive to my computer classes.
Other classes were boring and a chore for me. I could do it, but I had to make myself do it. When covid hit and everything went online it became even harder to keep myself accountable. I went from being straight A's and working hard to working even harder and straight c's.

I knew this wasn't the path for me. I knew something had to change. It's hard for me to put what changed for me into words. I guess it finally clicked that I was in charge and I really could choose my own destiny. If college wasn't making me excited to learn what was the point?

I got really lucky choosing Flatiron School. The instructors (Ahmed, Damon, Dane, Marc, Kyle) are FANTASTIC. You can tell that they just want to teach people and want to help with any problems. My favorite thing about Flatiron is just the atmoshpere they build. Meditations after stand up, constant breaks so you don't die, hilarious puns in the zoom chat as lessons are going, refusing to call lessons lectures, a tight group of students to work with, a larger group of students further into the program to also help you along, you learn a lot in a short amount of time. There's too much to list. I've already enjoyed my time so far and I know that I'll enjoy the rest of my time here too. Stay tuned for the week 2 wrap up and curriculum reviews!
